## Summary
This paper examines the idea that the sixth mass extinction in the last 540 million years has begun. This is due to the actions that humans have taken, resulting in loss of habitat, climate change, and many other negative implications. In this study, the authors hypothesize that the extinction rates are abnormally high and that without effective conservation efforts, we will see a sixth mass extinction over the next several centuries. The data that is used in this study is the fossil record and the background rate of extinction that we have seen over time, and the modern record of species and the current extinction rate. First, in order to effectively examine this data, the authors discuss the deficiencies that make this difficult. Both the fossil and modern records are deficient, largely due to undersampling and therefore extinction rates can be miscalculated. The metric used to make the comparison between modern and fossil is extinction per million species-years. Paleobiology databases are used to study the fossil record and lists of recently extinct species are used for the modern record. 

The first step taken is looking at three different scenarios. The first one, looks at extinction rates in one year time bins, showing that it is far above normal. The second looks at current rates compared to pre-anthropomorphic rates and show that they are clearly elevated. Finally, the study assumes that endangered species will go extinct over the next 1000 years, and again the rate is clearly higher than the geologic time-scale’s background extinction rate. Next, the paper seeks to compare the magnitude of species loss by percent loss. However, this proves to be difficult because of a lack of comparable data in the two records. For example, gastropod and bivalves are thoroughly sampled in the fossil record, but terrestrial data make up most of the modern record. Therefore the paper makes the assumption that current threatened species will become extinct in order to compare. This data reveals that the magnitude of extinction will reach anywhere from 21-52%. When looking at results, we know that the extinction rates are elevated. Maybe more significant, the paper notes that there may be more signs that the extinction is happening, such as reduction in geographic range of many species and lowered population abundance. 

## Likes
I really liked the perfect storm section of this paper. I found it interesting how the paper compared many of the different causes that have typically caused mass extinctions in the past, such as ecological stressors and climate change, to today’s world. I also thought it was interesting that all of these different risk factors for a mass extinction that in the past have been the result of chance forming a “perfect storm”, have been managed to all be caused by humans in today’s world. 


## Dislikes
One problem I had with this paper is it spent a significant percent of its time not talking about the topic, but the difficulty of the data related to the topic. In addition to having an entire section on the data disparity, which does seem necessary but sufficient, many of the other sections had a large amount of discussion, saying similar ideas that the data was difficult to compare based on sampling and a lack of complete species study in the modern record. I thought that this was a fascinating concept, but I would have like to read more about the topic’s information, results, causes, and even solutions rather than sampling. Another problem that I had with the study is that several times it made the assumption that threatened species would go extinct. While it may be necessary to make up for some of the sampling deficiencies, it is still a jump that may not be true, compromising the data. 

> Agree! I hate that assumption more than anything.

## Figures
Figure 1 shows extinction rates and their relationship to the time over which they happened, or E/MYS. I really did not like this figure because I thought it really lacked clarity. There were several different points of data attempted to be displayed with several different kinds of points, and it lacked a clear key to help the reader. Figure 2 shows the magnitude of current extinctions compared to the 75% benchmark. I thought this was a good figure because it showed it almost like the taxa were approaching the 75% mark, which nicely displays the point of view that this paper takes. Figure 3 shows the comparison of rate and magnitude of extinctions. This is another figure that I didn’t like for similar reasons of figure 1. There is too much information displayed in a relatively abstract way.
