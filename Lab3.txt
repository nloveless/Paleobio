Question 6
   1.  
   2. The morphological information on the Paleobiology Database can certainly help with the classifications, however, I don’t think these resources alone are enough to definitively classify the ammonites. One particular reason I say that is because variables such as sexual dimorphism can still leave a lot of grey area. For example, Glyptophiceras sinuatum’s shell diameter has a standard deviation of 16.5, which ranges the majority of the measurements that we saw. Another example of this is that for Xenoceltites variocostatus, the diameter mean is 23.5, but the maximum is 78.0. Therefore, with the resources given, we can come close to the correct classifications, but can not be completely certain.

   4. With the pictures of the Xenoceltites variocostatus and the information about their measurements, this would be enough information to classify the specimens from lab 2 with a high enough degree of certainty.
