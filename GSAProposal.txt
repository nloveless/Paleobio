Introduction:
My objective is to examine how the extinction rates of non-dominant species, those who are not the single most dominant species, in an ecosystem respond to different levels of dominance the most dominant species. On a larger scale, this study is designed to help discover different mechanisms of extinction, which are still not completely understood. Because we are in a time with an extreme number of extinctions, it is crucial for the stability of existing life that we develop a better understanding of extinction.(Barnosky et al., 2011) In this study, we will examine specific ecosystems with different levels of dominance, and attempt to draw conclusions from the resulting extinction rates. Dominance will be defined as the percent of the occurrences that each species make up in an ecosystem. I hypothesize that the marine ecosystems around named rock formations with high dominance levels will exhibit extinction rates of the other, non-dominant species. This is likely because as many ecologists believe such as Bonsall and Hassell(1997), competition will increase extinction rates. This increased extinction will be felt more by the non-dominant species because the dominant species will be more fit for the ecosystem and outcompete the other species. 
Justification:
        Since Darwin, it has been hypothesized, and accepted as true that extinction is not a random event.(Darwin, 1859) Following this, biologists, paleontologists and many others have tried to answer the question: what makes a taxon more likely to be selected for, and what traits make a taxon more likely to go extinct. Many factors, such as geographic range, body size, and population size, among other traits have all been associated as predictors of extinction.(Cardillo et al., 2005) However, there is still much that is unknown about extinctions and what can cause them. For this reason, I want to further study potential predicting factors of extinction. 
        This study is necessary today because we are currently seeing an abnormally high amount of extinctions. In fact, some articles suggest that the sixth mass extinction in the history of life could have “already arrived.”(Barnosky et al., 2011) If humans want to avoid an extreme loss of life and diversity on Earth, arguably directly caused by humans due to things such as dramatically increased pollution, deforestation, and the destruction of many other ecosystems, both time and money need to be invested into the study of extinction.(Vitousek, Mooney, and Lubchenco, 1997) This can give conservationists a better chance to combat the increase in extinction that we have already begun to see. 
        This study would be an important piece of the effort to further understand extinction for many reasons. First, dominance has never been studied as a direct causation for extinction or other taxa in the same ecosystem. While these two factors have been correlated before, it was only thought to be correlated by a third variable.(Olff and Ritchie, 1998) Secondly, it can be well justified, ecologically, that sharing an ecosystem with a dominant species would increase extinction rate. This is because it leads to direct competition with that species. As said by Slatkin(1974), competition increases extinction rate. I hypothesize that this increased extinction will be felt more by the non-dominant species in the ecosystem due to the fact that the dominant species is better adapted for the particular ecosystem and will therefore outcompete the non-dominant taxa. 
Methods:
        The first step in this study is to identify ecosystems with varying levels of the most dominant species immediately prior to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The ecosystems being studied will be limited to marine ecosystems surrounding named rock formations because availability of rock will have a positive effect on the quality of the fossil record. This is important for this study because the number of occurrences are key to the result. The simple presence of an occurrence is not helpful, but we will be needing an accurate account of how many occurrences are found. In this study, dominance will be measured by the percent of occurrences that one species makes up in an environment. The data for this study will come from the Paleobiology Database. This will be my source of data for several reasons. First, it is convenient, because it easily accessible.  Another reason is that it is a reliable source of data as well as easily reproducible.  Following this step, we will look at the same environments and find the percentage of species in each environment that went extinct in the mass extinction event. These percentages will then be graphed on the y-axis, and the x-axis will be the original dominance, prior to the extinction event. Displaying the data graphically is appealing because it can directly reveal trends that arise from the comparison of the two variables. For my hypothesis to be proved correct, we will need to see a statistically significant trend of an increasing percent of species lost as the dominance increases. To prove these are statistically significant, a t test will be performed against the null hypothesis that these two variables are uncorrelated.
