Origination and Extinction

## Summary

This study takes a wide view on the qualities surrounding extinction and origination by examining the five mass extinctions defined by Raup and Sepkoski. Specifically, this study <strike>will</strike> evaluates <strike>the fact that</strike> whether extinctions are not truly a wide differentiation from the background extinction rate but simply the upward bound of the normal curve of extinction rates. Further, the study will consider extinction, as well as origination as the cause of the five mass extinctions. The authors hypothesize that the extinction events do not have anything truly in common besides the fact that the end result is a great loss in diversity and have different causes and effects. The first step in this process is tracking the change of diversity over the time. The data for this portion of the study comes from Sepkoski et al. (1981). The study then looks at each of the five intervals loss in diversity of taxa, showing that these are the only five events that have a 20% loss in diversity. The study then began to specifically at continuity. Without further analysis, there are six events that do not seem to fit the continual model, four of which are within the big five extinctions, further, they removed the Ordovician extinction because its magnitude was extremely different. To examine this further, they test each of these four event in a temporal context. After looking at continuity, the paper considers origination and extinction and concludes that two of the five “mass extinctions” are truly just a loss in origination, that was coupled with high, but not dramatically, high extinction rate. This left three of the big five extinctions that extinction are directly responsible for. The paper concludes that these three are mass extinctions and not just depletion of diversity caused by several different factors. These three events do not agree with the idea of continuity. Finally, the paper considers the idea that the extinction events are simply a deficiency in the fossil record. While the authors agree that this could potentially be a contributing factor, it is not thought that in any of the five extinctions that this could be a complete driving force of the apparent loss of diversity. 

## Likes

Even though the paper decided that continuity of extinction rates was not the explanation of at least three of the five mass extinctions, I really enjoyed the testing of this idea and how the paper presented it. When first reading through this paper, I thought that this was extremely intuitive and that it offered at least a potentially statistical explanation of what were previously thought of as dramatic deviations from the background extinction rate. I thought that this was presented in a very clear way, using the idea of the continuous curve to show that there logically would be rare times with extremely high extinction rates. Furthermore, the ideas that Wang (2003) presented were discussed in a clear and thorough way. The study considers these ideas and tests to see if cause, effect, and magnitude are consistent among the mass extinctions. For example, the study does a good job looking for consistent cause when discussing the ideas of looking at both changes in diversity as a function of origination and extinction rates, ultimately deciding that these five mass extinctions do not have a consistent cause. 

## Dislikes

One problem that I had with this paper is that it uses Sepkoski’s ideas about diversity. This includes the dramatic Cenozoic increase in diversity. However, this is now greatly debated whether this increase was not nearly as dramatic as proposed by Sepkoski or whether this change happened at all. Therefore, I think it opens this study to significant amounts of potential error. Secondly, I looked for some sort of explanation for why there were decreases in origination during the late Frasnian and the end-Triassic, but this paper did not offer any.

## Figures

Figure 1 is a display of diversity over time with the five mass extinctions being highlighted. This is clear and uncomplicated. Figure 2 is a proportional change in diversity of taxa throughout time. Figure 3 is a proportional change in extinction rate for each time interval in the Phanerozoic, and also just the Middle Ordovician to the Pleistocene. Again, it is a fairly simple graph and clear. Figure 4 displays genus extinction over time. A does this by proposition, B does by this by the natural log of proportional change, and C only looks at trilobite extinction. I like these figures but they were just small and hard to read. Figure 5 A is a non-linear regression line of the varying genus extinction rates. B is a histogram of this data. I think here the histogram does a good job of displaying that the mass extinctions are unique from the background extinction rates. Figure 6 is a line graph with both extinction and origination rates displayed. This figure is nice because it outlines the mass extinctions, helping the reader look at these two variables and consider which is responsible for this depletion event. Figure 7 is similar to Figure 6, except this only displays the true mass “extinction” events. Figure 8 now looks at the two non-extinction driven depletion events. This figure displays the fact that these depletion events were actually a lack of origination. Finally, Figure 9 displays both diversity and turnover over time.
