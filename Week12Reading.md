## Summary

This paper looks at two models of evolution throughout the geological time scale. The first model is the Red Queen model, where evolution and extinction is caused by biotic factors such as competition. The other model that is examined is the Court Jester model. This model suggests that it is abiotic factors that are the driving force. These usually come as dramatic changes to the physical environment caused by things such as climate change, shifting tectonic plates, or changing oceanography. This paper hypothesizes that these two are both correct, depending on the scale that you are considering. The larger the scale, geologically and time, the more the Court Jester model causes evolutionary change. However, when looking at a specific region, the Red Queen model is more responsible for evolution and extinction. 

First, the paper looks at the two prominent models of species diversification, Sepkoskiâ€™s original model and the model corrected for fossil record errors. Next, the paper considers the specific controls that affect diversity. First, patterns of abiotic driven diversification are discussed. For example, the tectonic plate shifts that are correlated with species diversification. Another abiotic factor that has been theorized to drive diversification is energy. The ecosystems with more energy, often high temperature, have more diversity. The paper then examines phylogenetic studies and clades. Species evolved from microbes 3.5 billion years ago and phylogeny attempts to map out the evolutionary path taxa have evolved. This is important to this topic, because if we can accurately map out phylogenetic trees and correlate the times of great diversification with specific abiotic events, then the Joker model is more likely to be correct, and if they are not correlated, the Queen model looks to be more accurate. Finally, the paper looks at the importance of comparing sister taxa. By tracking and comparing to sister taxa, we can look at evolution beginning from a consistent starting point. Sister taxa allow a good way to test the resource-use hypothesis that says species that need more specific resources are more likely to go extinct. This hypothesis stresses the importance of abiotic factors because the sister taxa started from the same biotic background.

## Likes

In this paper, I found the conversation about energy as a abiotic factor that drives diversification a fascinating idea. This was a new theory that I had not heard discussed before and I was very intrigued by it. I thought that the author did a good job lending credibility to this idea by discussing the diversification of taxa on a global scale, looking at the tropics which have a high diversity, and more temperate and arctic environments. While the reading does offer the alternate explanation that this is due to the fact that the tropics are simply older and larger than the colder global zones, I find the energy hypothesis also very interesting. 

## Dislikes

My major complaint about this paper was the lack of a clarity. First, in neither the introduction, nor the abstract is there a clear, well-defined hypothesis. While the paper and figures do a good job by the end of the paper in showing what is being argued, the reader does not have a clear idea of what is being argued from the beginning of the paper. This problem is also seen in several of the sections of the paper where what is being discussed is not brought back to the focus of the paper, the Red Queen and Court Jester hypotheses, until the last couple sentences. I thought this problem was especially apparent in the section on phylogeny.  

> I agree. On one hand as a review paper a hypothesis isn't quite necessary, but empirical predicitons of red queen vs court jester are never really made clear.

## Figures

Figure 1 is a graphical representation of where the Joker and Queen models are appropriate at different temporal and geological scales in Part A. This seems like an unnecessary graph to me. The geological scale is largely arbitrary and so is the graphed data. This is also true with Part B. The x axis is simple marked more and less, which is extremely ambiguous. Figure 2 is a representation of the change in diversity over time. It both demonstrates the Sepkoski data and the data corrected for fossil errors. This is a fairly simply figure and is like many that we have seen already. Figure 3 displays the phylogenetic relationships and morphospace occupation of archosaurs in the Triassic. Table 1 shows the different data that supports either the Red Queen, Court Jester, and the Multilevel Hypothesis. This is clear and helpful.
