## Summary:

This paper set out to test the strength that geographic range has on the ability of a genera to survive extinction. Also, the paper studies this in between mass extinction, not before and after a mass extinction. It does this to attempt to shed light on extinction mechanism in the much more common, background extinction, rather than that of the mass extinction, whose mechanisms are often better understood. First, the study uses data acquired from the Paleobiology Database. This data is limited to marine invertebrates in benthic environments. This amounted to 227,229 occurrences of 12,300 different genera over a 500 My stretch from the Middle Cambrian to the Middle Miocene. These are then broken down into 10 My intervals. In order to analyse the data, the Payne and Finnegan used logarithmic regression to compare survival versus extinction over varying range size. To avoid confounding variables such as population size and species richness multiple regressions were used. To test for the effect that heterogeneous sampling had on range selectivity, five metrics of record quality were examined. Data was further culled by throwing out eras that were unreliable, such as those with mass extinctions or with insufficient data due to things such as a lack of sampling. After compiling and analyzing the data, the authors conclude that the geographic range size of a genus is an effective determinant of extinction probability, and in fact, may be the most important factor. Another important takeaway from this study is that the higher the background extinction rate at the time interval, the lower effect the range size has on the likelihood of survival. 

## Likes

One thing that I found extremely well done about this paper was the way that it worked with the raw data and considered confounding variables. First, the authors are smart to look at the range data independent of two confounding variables, richness and population size by performing multiple regressions. Furthermore, the authors cull the data where the fossil data is inconsistent and incomplete. This is done after they were impressively thorough, looking at five different metrics of record quality. These measures were impressively detailed and make the results significantly more important and trustworthy. Next, I really enjoyed the idea of looking at the background extinction rates as opposed to mass extinctions. This is something that is less studied, even though there are only five mass big extinctions and this background data makes up such a large portion of the geologic time scale and the paper also mentions that up to 80% of extinctions happen between mass extinctions. 
## Dislikes:

One small detail that bothered me about this paper was its structure. Instead of following the typical structure, the methods are squeezed in at the end of the paper instead of right after the introduction. I had a harder time following what was happening in the paper because of this and after reading the methods had to go back to the results to better understand. Another problem I had is that there was no discussion beyond statistics about the intervals between mass extinctions. One part of this paper was supposed to examine this background data, however in the discussion section, the only time the authors look beyond to the numbers to actual biological causes of these trends was when they looked at mass extinctions.

> This format is common for shorter form articles. This is because these papers often assume that the methods are good, and they want to focus on the results.

## Figures

Figure 1 shows the log odds of survivorship versus range size over 500 million years. The positive values show that they are positively related and the negative indicate an inverse relationship. The graph also put in confidence intervals of 95% around each of the points. There are two plots, one after one logistic regression and the other after several. I thought this was well done and clear. It also clearly shows that they are positively related. Figure 2 is a simple scatter plot of the log odds versus the extinction intensity. This figure is a little hard to pull data from, simple because there is no best fit line or something to clearly demonstrate the trend. However, I thought it was useful that they included different time periods within the plot. Figure 3 is the null plot, assuming that extinction is completely independent across geoplates. This plots the expected log odds of extinction rates versus the observed log odds of extinction rates.
