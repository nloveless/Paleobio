Problem Set 1
1. 634. table(BivalveAbundance[“Miocene”,]) take the number of 0s, subtracted from the total. 2272-1638= 634
2. .22. PlioceneBrachiopod<-BrachiopodAbundance["Pliocene",]
> max(PlioceneBrachiopod)
> sum(PlioceneBrachiopod)
> 22/99 
3. 0.9784588. 
BrachiopodsOrdovician<- BrachiopodAbundance["Late Ordovician",]
> sum(BrachiopodsOrdovician)
[1] 6154
> 1-sum((BrachiopodsOrdovician/6154)^2)
[1] 0.9784588
4. 7.338286  
 if (min(BivalvesLateCretaceous) < 0 || sum(BivalvesLateCretaceous) <= 0) return(NA)
p.norm <- BivalvesLateCretaceous[BivalvesLateCretaceous>0]/sum(BivalvesLateCretaceous)
-sum(log2(p.norm)*p.norm)
5. 6.508088  
if (min(BivalvesPaleocene) < 0 || sum(BivalvesPaleocene) <= 0) 1return(NA)
p.norm <- BivalvesPaleocene[BivalvesPaleocene>0]/sum(BivalvesPaleocene)
-sum(log2(p.norm)*p.norm)
6. -11.31324% This difference can be related to the mass extinction that took place at the boundary of the two time periods.
7. -56.40371659% This does better demonstrate the true difference that occurred. This is because the diversity indices are not an accurate measure of diversity until they are converted to effective numbers by exponentiating them. 


Problem Set 2

2. > diversity(BrachiopodsOrdovician, index = "simpson")      [1] 0.9784588
3. > diversity(BivalvesLateCretaceous)     [1] 5.086512
4. > diversity(BivalesPaleocene)        [1] 4.511063


Problem Set 3
1. > cor(BivalveRichness, BrachiopodRichness)      [1] -0.567095
        Therefore, the Brachiopod richness is negatively correlated to Bivalves.
2. > cor(BivalveDiversity, BrachiopodDiversity)
[1] 0.4853795
The diversity of Brachiopods is positively correlated to Bivalve diversity.
3. The greatest drop in Brachiopod richness occurred between Early Devonian and the Pridoli.

2.  > cor(BrachiopodRichness, StandardizedBrachiopodRichness)
[1] 0.879321
        We can see that the the correlation between standardized and nonstandardized Brachiopod richness is very high because perfect correlation is 1 and the .879 value is very close to that.  
   1. > plot(StandardizedRichness, StandardizedBrachiopodRichness, xlab = "Bivalve", ylab = "Brachiopod")
> plot(BivalveRichness, BrachiopodRichness, xlab = "Bivalve", ylab = "Brachiopod") 
The standardized plot has a fairly random distribution across the plot. The non-standardized plot is more clustered close to the axis of the plot. The standardization does matter because it allows us to have a more evenly balanced set of data that is unbiased for one epoch over another. 
4. I think that the negative correlation that Brachiopods have with Bivalves where richness is concerned and the plot of the richness of the two genera prove that when Bivalves increase in richness, Brachiopods decrease. However, I don’t think that there is enough data here to show that out competition was the overall cause of this relationship. There could be a correlation to another variable that this lab does not consider.
