Problem Set 1
1. Miocene: 602. Miocene <- PresencePBDB["Miocene",]       >sum(Miocene)
        Early Jurassic: 162. > EarlyJurassic <- (PresencePBDB["Early Jurassic",])
> sum(EarlyJurassic)
Late Cretaceous: 375. LateCretaceous <- (PresencePBDB["Late Cretaceous",])
> sum(LateCretaceous)
Pennsylvanian: 133. Pennsylvanian <- (PresencePBDB["Pennsylvanian",])
> sum(Pennsylvanian)
2. 29. dim(PresencePBDB)
3. Pridoli, Early Devonian, Cisuralian, Late Jurassic, Eocene, Late Cretaceous, Early Cretaceous, Middle Jurassic, Paleocene, Oligocene, Miocene, Early Jurassic, Pleistocene, Middle Triassic, Late Triassic, Pliocene, Early Triassic. Mytilus <- (PresencePBDB[,"Mytilus"])
4. Middle Devonian, Late Devonian, Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, Guadalupian, Lopingian. We know this because Mytilus was present in the epochs surrounding these epochs. The taxa would not have gone extinct and then originated again.


Problem Set 2
1. >Pleistocene <- (PresencePBDB["Pleistocene",]
>MiocenePleistocene <- c("Pleistocene", "Miocene")
 MiocenePleistocene <- data.frame(Miocene, Pleistocene)
> Sumsepochs <- rowSums(MiocenePleistocene)
> table(Sumsepochs)
Sumsepochs

287 106 509 
> 509/(902+902-509)
[1] 0.3930502


2. 1-Jaccard Index= Jaccard Distance


3. > MiocenePleistocene<-PresencePBDB[c("Miocene", "Pleistocene"),]
 vegdist(MiocenePleistocene, methods="jaccard")
               Miocene
Pleistocene 0.09430605


4. The Paleocene and Pleistocene are most dissimilar at  0.28498468.
> Epochs <- PresencePBDB[c("Pleistocene", "Pliocene", "Miocene", "Oligocene", "Eocene", "Paleocene"),]
> vegdist(Epochs, methods="jaccard")


Problem Set 3
1. > RandomEpochs <- PresencePBDB[c("Pliocene", "Oligocene", "Paleocene", "Early Cretaceous", "Late Jurassic", "Middle Jurassic"),]
2. > vegdist(RandomEpochs, methods="jaccard")
3. Poles: Middle Jurassic, Pliocene.
Gradient: Middle Jurassic, Late Jurassic, Early Cretaceous, Paleocene, Oligocene, Pliocene
4. The thing that stuck out to me is that there seemed to be a more diverse amount of marine life on the Middle Jurassic end of the gradient. This could create more competition and favor certain species more than others. Another possibility is that the Pliocene side of the spectrum seemed to be cooler.
5. There was a mass extinction between the two epochs which could create dramatically different ecosystems, promoting some species to go extinct and others to originate, resulting in the dramatic difference.


Problem Set 4
1.URL <- https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/occs/list.csv?datainfo&rowcount&base_name=animalia&interval=Ordovician,Ordovician


 Ordovician <- read.csv(URL)


2. Ordovician <- cleanGenus(Ordovician)


3. Ordovician<-presenceMatrix(Ordovician,SampleDefinition="early_interval")
Ordovician<-cullMatrix(Ordovician,minOccurrences=2,minDiversity=25)




4.  Ordovician[1:5,c(“geoplate”,”paleolat”,”paleolng”)]


tapply(Ordovician[,“paleolat”], Ordovician[,geoplate], mean)
                            [,”paleolat”]


I think that the samples are oriented based to the latitudes. I was able to decide this based on the the means that were the results of my code.
